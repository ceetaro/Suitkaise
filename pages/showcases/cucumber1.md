1. Start with a black screen. 
2. Center screen - “I never wanted to see a single PicklingError again.” then fade out
3. Fade in “So, I created a monster. One that nothing could handle.”
4. Now, we slowly remove the black screen to reveal: the monster image with only the eyes showing using a gradient
5. Next, we zoom it out. 
6. This is where title appears: "WORST POSSIBLE OBJECT" and botton text under person "vs cucumber
7. Instead of just displaying them, lets have the lines of source code “go into” the monster like its absorbing it as power. 
8. At the same time, the plain language on the other side is doing the same thing: getting “absorbed” by the monster.
9. 7 and 8 should take about 7 seconds to fully complete.
10. Dim to black again.
10.5 start snow animation
- "All of those types added to one single object."
- fade to black again
11. “Pickle can’t handle it”
12. “Cloudpickle can’t handle it”
13. “Dill cant handle it”
14. Fade this text so we have a black screen. clear text.
15. Fade in “But with cucumber? Not even an issue.” Fade out
15.5 we should have a black screen with snow animation right now.
16. Now this is where the case opens using the image cycling animation.
- Open the case in the center of the screen
- Once fully opened, move it down.
- This makes space for the typing animation.
17. Now, do the typing animation.
18. As the typing animation ends, remove the black screen. 
19. Behind the black screen, we have another gradient darkening everything. This is putting focus on the person at the bottom of the image.
20. When the typing animation starts, we start “powering up” the character. mkae this look really good and cool. Keep the scene fully black outside of the person’s area. Increase the opacity of the image as the person powers up.
21. Once monster image opacity is back at 100, slowly “zoom out” the focus until the full image is visible again. 
22. While zooming out 21, move everything to the left to make room for the video.
23. Start playing the video. the top and bottom of the video should be fully visible in the carousel viewport. Video should be at .9 opacity.
25. This is also when you do the counting. this count from 1-1000 should start 1.5s into the video and end 27.5 secs in.
26. Stay at 1000, the final number, for a bit. This one doesn’t pop and fade like the other numbers.
27. Go to black screen. The only thing that remains is that moving number 1000.
28. Move the 1000 to the correct position so it can fit in this sentence on the outro screen: “cucumber can beat 1000 objects designed to break it with ease.”
29. Fade in “It can do the same for you.”
