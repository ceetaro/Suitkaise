# SKPath TODO

The only things left to do are:
- [ ] Create an example.py file that can run different examples using the skpath module
- [ ] Create the info.md file that explains the inner workings of the skpath module
- [ ] Retest the API in its final form entirely
- [ ] Ensure that other suitkaise modules are compatible with the skpath module when dealing with paths
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Test performance and optimize
- [ ] Bolster error handling across api and internal engine with custom exceptions
