# SKPath TODO

First, resolve all the TODOs in path_ops.py and skpath/api.py. *

Next, re update the concept.md file to reflect the small changes. *

## Core Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Update the example.py file to be super detailed and comprehensive
- [ ] Create the info.md file that explains the inner workings of the skpath module
- [ ] Retest the API in its final form entirely
- [ ] Test performance and optimize
- [ ] Test thread safety

- [ ] ensure _get_formatted_project_tree() checks for unicode support using fdl/_int/setup/unicode.py and raises error if unsupported *

## Code TODOs from Implementation Files
- [ ] Add indicator list and algorithm explanation to info.md (concept.md:218)

## Integration and Testing (DEFERRED)
- [ ] Ensure that other suitkaise modules are compatible with the skpath module when dealing with paths
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility
