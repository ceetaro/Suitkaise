waiting using Event.wait()


ex. Event.wait(if_event=FullScanStarted, for_event=FullScanFinished,
                timeout=100)

advanced usage of Event.wait()
ex. Event.wait(if_event=QuickScanStarted, for_event=QuickScanFinished, 
                keys={'file', 'Path/To/MyFile.py'})


Event.wait() is a blocking call that will check the event bus from the most 
recent event backwards.

If the more recent event is if_event, it will execute its code, and instead
subscribe to the for_event.

If the more recent event is for_event, it will execute its code as normal.

If there is a key argued, it will check each event for the key, and ignore events
that do not match all keys.

For higher precision, you can alternatively use if_keys and/or for_keys 
instead of keys.
