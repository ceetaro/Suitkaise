# Licensing

This software is available under your choice of the following licenses:

1. Apache License, Version 2.0 (see LICENSE.APACHE)
2. The GNU General Public License v3.0 (see LICENSE.GPL)

You may select either license. Using this software and/or application constitutes acceptance of the terms of the license you choose.

## Selection Guidelines

* **Apache 2.0**: Choose this license if you want to incorporate Suitkaise (or any part of Suitkaise's code) into proprietary software, need patent protection, or 
require more flexible terms. 

This option allows integration without requiring your entire codebase to be open source.

Examples under Apache Licensing: 

- using Suitkaise to develop a commercially available application, which runs using source code from Suitkaise. Applications developed mainly using Suitkaise will likely have Suitkaise's source code present, even if the application is running on its own.

- using Suitkaise as a base to create an internal custom code editor

* **GNU GPL v3**: Choose this license if you are developing open source software, and want to ensure that all modifications, improvements, and derivative works remain open source.

Please note that choosing this option REQUIRES that ANY software incorporating Suitkaise (or any part of Suitkaise's code) must also be released under GPL v3.

Examples under General Public Licensing:

- making a direct modification (like changing a color theme) or a direct improvement (like adding language support) to the open source Suitkaise licensed under GPL v3, or any derivative works of Suitkaise under this license.

- using and editing Suitkaise source code to better tailor Suitkaise towards personal (non-commercial) use.
